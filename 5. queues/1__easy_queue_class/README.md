### Queue Class

Implement the class Queue using stacks. The queue methods you need to implement are enqueue, dequeue, peek and empty.

empty: return a boolean value of whether the queue is empty or not.

### Step 1. Constraint Questions:

-   Do the queue methods we have to implement need to perform a the same complexity of a real queue? `No, but they should be as performant as possible`

### Step 2. Test Cases:

N/A

### Step 3. Figure out a solution without code.
