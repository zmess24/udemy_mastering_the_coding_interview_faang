### (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)[Maximum Depth of a Biary Tree]

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
